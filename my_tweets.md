@glean @suno @MistralAI @huggingface @argilla_io @Gradio @pollenrobotics Sometimes I wonder whether people even care about these non #nlproc non-work posts, lol... 

At least, my future self can look back at my thoughts =)

@glean @suno @MistralAI @huggingface @argilla_io @Gradio @pollenrobotics BTW, for those who doesn't know @glean is at a sort of odd place competing with many other similar alternatives. They raised 150M for 7.2B valuation for series F recently. So that assumes that net burn rate is higher than @huggingface to raise capital for growth.

@glean @suno @MistralAI @huggingface FYI, for those who don't know the answer... It's @huggingface and it's kinda awesome that their acquisition of @argilla_io @Gradio @pollenrobotics scales and integrates well. 

I wonder... I'm assuming that series pause means their cashflow is good and burn rate is acceptable.
